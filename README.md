# opencv-tests
Testing OpenCV functionalities.

## Description
This project demonstrates various functionalities of OpenCV by processing video frames from a webcam. Users can toggle between different image processing modes through keypresses.

- **Gaussian Blur**: `b`
- **Canny Edge Detection**: `c`
- **HSV (Hue, Saturation, Value) Color Space**: `h`
- **Threshold (Binary Thresholding)**: `t`
- **Sobel Edge Detection**: `s`
- **Object Detection (YOLOv4)**: `o`
- **Close Program**: `ESC`

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- OpenCV library: Install using pip with `pip install opencv-python`
- YOLOv4 pre-trained weights (automatically downloaded by the script)
- NumPy and Requests libraries: `pip install numpy requests`
